# MPSO_CCD_Method
This optimization software is documented in the file "PSO_Manual" which provides the stepwise guidelines for the serial as well as parallel implementation of MPSO_CCD algorithm. It is a global optimization technique which combines the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with the cyclic coordinate descent(CCD) local optimizer. Therefore it incorporates  the global search characteristics of the PSO algorithm with the local search capability of the CCD algorithm. This unique combination provides a better performance by balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. We further implement the MPSO_CCD algorithm in a parallel environment to increase the scalability.
